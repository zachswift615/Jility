# Jility Full-Text Search Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have implemented a comprehensive full-text search system for Jility that works seamlessly with both SQLite (local development) and PostgreSQL (cloud/production). The implementation includes database migrations, backend services, API endpoints, and frontend components.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Layer

#### Migration File
**Location:** `/home/user/Jility/crates/jility-core/src/migration/m20241024_000002_add_fts.rs`

**SQLite Implementation (FTS5):**
- Created virtual FTS tables for tickets and comments
- Implemented Porter stemming with Unicode tokenization
- Added automatic triggers to keep FTS in sync with main tables
- Uses BM25 ranking algorithm for relevance scoring

**PostgreSQL Implementation (tsvector):**
- Added `search_vector` column to tickets and comments tables
- Created GIN indexes for fast full-text search
- Implemented automatic triggers with weighted ranking (title = 'A', description = 'B')
- Uses ts_rank for relevance scoring

**Saved Views Table:**
- Database-agnostic table for storing user search preferences
- Supports per-user views with default and shared options

### 2. Backend Service Layer

#### Search Types
**Location:** `/home/user/Jility/jility-core/src/search/types.rs`

Implemented comprehensive types:
- `SearchFilters` - Advanced filtering with 15+ filter options
- `SearchResult` - Rich result type with snippets and ranking
- `SearchResponse` - Paginated response with metadata

#### Search Service
**Location:** `/home/user/Jility/jility-core/src/search/service.rs`

Features:
- Database backend detection and abstraction
- Unified API for SQLite FTS5 and PostgreSQL tsvector
- Query escaping and sanitization
- Snippet generation with `<mark>` highlighting
- Relevance ranking with combined results from tickets and comments
- Full pagination support

#### Entity Model
**Location:** `/home/user/Jility/jility-core/src/entities/saved_view.rs`

Created SavedView entity for storing search preferences

### 3. API Layer

#### Updated Routes
**Location:** `/home/user/Jility/jility-server/src/api/search.rs`

Implemented endpoints:
- `GET /api/search` - Advanced search with full filtering
- `GET /api/search/views` - List saved views
- `GET /api/search/views/:id` - Get specific view

- **Status:** Multiple status filters
- **Assignees:** Filter by assigned users
- **Labels:** Filter by labels
- **Creator:** Filter by who created the ticket
- **Date Ranges:** Created/updated before/after
- **Story Points:** Min/max range
- **Relations:** Has comments, commits, dependencies
- **Hierarchy:** Filter by epic or parent ticket
- **Scope:** Search in title, description, and/or comments
- **Pagination:** Limit and offset

#### State Management
**Location:** `/home/user/Jility/jility-server/src/state.rs`

Added SearchService to AppState for dependency injection

### 4. Frontend Layer

- `updateSavedView()` - Update existing view
- `deleteSavedView()` - Delete view

#### Hooks
**Location:** `/home/user/Jility/jility-web/lib/hooks.ts`

Created `useDebounce` hook for delayed search execution (300ms)

#### Search Bar Component
**Location:** `/home/user/Jility/jility-web/components/search/search-bar.tsx`

Features:

- Filter sidebar with:
  - Status multi-select badges
  - Created by input
  - Story points range
  - Boolean filters (has comments, commits, dependencies)
- Saved views panel
  - List of saved views
  - Click to load view
  - Save current search as view
- Search results:
  - Relevance score display
  - Highlighted snippets
  - Metadata (status, points, assignees, labels)
  - Matched fields display
  - Pagination with "Load More"
- Applied filters display with removable chips
- URL-based state (shareable links)

## Database Compatibility

The search system automatically detects the database backend and uses the appropriate implementation:

| Feature | SQLite (FTS5) | PostgreSQL (tsvector) |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Search Algorithm | BM25 | ts_rank |
| Stemming | Porter | English |
| Highlighting | snippet() | ts_headline() |
| Auto-sync | Triggers | Triggers |
| Performance | Excellent | Excellent |

## Search Features

### 1. Full-Text Search
- Searches across ticket titles, descriptions, and comments
- Automatic stemming (e.g., "running" matches "run")
- Phrase matching with quotes
- Relevance ranking

### 2. Advanced Filtering
- **Status:** Multiple selection (todo, in_progress, etc.)
- **Assignees:** Filter by assigned users
- **Labels:** Filter by labels
- **Creator:** Filter by who created the ticket
- **Date Ranges:** Created or updated within a date range
- **Story Points:** Filter by point range
- **Relations:** Tickets with comments, commits, or dependencies
- **Hierarchy:** Filter by epic or parent ticket

### Future Optimizations
- Redis caching for popular queries
- Search result prefetching
- Background re-indexing for bulk operations

## Usage Examples

### Quick Search (Navigation Bar)

```tsx
import { SearchBar } from '@/components/search/search-bar'

export function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav className="flex items-center gap-4">
      <SearchBar />
    </nav>
  )
}
```

### Advanced Search Page

Navigate to `/search?q=authentication` or use the search bar's "View all results" link.

### API Usage

```bash
# Simple search
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=authentication"

# Advanced search with filters
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=auth&status=todo&status=in_progress&assignees=alice&min_points=5"

# Create saved view
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/search/views \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Active Tasks",
    "filters": {
      "q": "",
      "status": ["in_progress"],
      "assignees": ["alice"]
    }
  }'
```

### TypeScript API

```typescript
import { api } from '@/lib/api'

// Advanced search
const response = await api.advancedSearch({
  q: 'authentication',
  status: ['todo', 'in_progress'],
  assignees: ['alice'],
  min_points: 5,
  limit: 20,
})

console.log(response.results) // Array of SearchResult
console.log(response.total)   // Total count
console.log(response.has_more) // More results available?

// Saved views
const views = await api.listSavedViews()
const view = await api.createSavedView({
  name: 'High Priority',
  filters: { q: '', status: ['todo'], min_points: 8 }
})
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
cd /home/user/Jility
cargo run -p jility-server
```

The migration will run automatically and create FTS tables/columns.

### 2. Create Test Data

```bash
# Create some tickets
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tickets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Implement JWT authentication",
    "description": "Add JWT-based authentication for API endpoints",
    "status": "todo",
    "story_points": 5
  }'

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tickets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Add OAuth integration",
    "description": "Integrate OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "story_points": 8
  }'
```

### 3. Test Search

```bash
# Search for "authentication"
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=authentication"

# Should return both tickets with highlighted snippets
# JWT ticket should rank higher (exact match in title)
```

### 4. Test Filters

```bash
# Search with status filter
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=auth&status=todo"

# Should return only the JWT ticket

# Search with story points filter
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=auth&min_points=7"

# Should return only the OAuth ticket
```

### 5. Test Frontend

```bash
cd jility-web
npm run dev
```

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`
2. Type "auth" in the search bar
3. See live suggestions appear
4. Click "View all results" to go to advanced search
5. Try applying filters
6. Save the current search as a view

## Documentation

- **SEARCH_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Comprehensive documentation covering architecture, API, usage, and troubleshooting
- **SEARCH_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - This file, summarizing what was implemented

## Known Limitations

1. **Query Syntax:** Advanced boolean operators work differently on SQLite vs PostgreSQL
2. **Pagination:** Uses offset-based pagination (not ideal for very large result sets)
3. **No Caching:** All searches hit the database (Redis caching planned)
4. **Single Language:** Only English stemming is configured

## Future Enhancements

See the "Future Enhancements" section in SEARCH_DOCUMENTATION.md for a full list of planned features including:
- Advanced query syntax parser
- Fuzzy matching for typos
- Search analytics
- Multi-language support
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K)
- Faceted search
- Export to CSV

## Conclusion

The full-text search system is now fully implemented and ready to use. It provides:

- ✅ Fast, relevant full-text search
- ✅ Advanced filtering with 15+ filter options
- ✅ Saved views for quick access
- ✅ Beautiful, intuitive UI
- ✅ Database compatibility (SQLite + PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Production-ready with automatic indexing
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

The system is designed to scale with your project, from local development with SQLite to production deployment with PostgreSQL.
